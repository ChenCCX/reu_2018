    "### Connecting to Bridges\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to connect to Bridges is an account that gives you access.  Most of you will have a created an XSEDE user account at this point which requires Two Factor Authentication to log into systems with the [Single Sign On (SSO) Hub](https://portal.xsede.org/web/xup/single-sign-on-hub).  For more information on XSEDE 2FA go [here](https://portal.xsede.org/web/xup/single-sign-on-hub).  To forgo having to keep an additional device or method of login you can setup a password specific to Bridges [here](https://apr.psc.edu/autopwdreset/autopwdreset.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your PSC credentials you will be able to SSH into Bridges from any SSH client.  SSH (Secure Shell) is an encrytped way to access remote systems so your data is safe.  For more info on this go [here](https://www.psc.edu/about-using-ssh).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users you will need an SSH client application.  There are many different options available but for brevity I'll show you how to use PuTTY.  You can download it [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).  Once you download and install PuTTY you should see this screen when you open it up.\n",
    "***\n",
    "![PuTTY Login Screen](/images/putty_default_login.png)\n",
    "***\n",
    "All you need to do is edit the Host Name box with your _username@bridges.psc.edu_ and then click __Open__.  With success you should see a screen like this\n",
    "***\n",
    "![PuTTY Fingerprint](/images/putty_rsa_accept.png) \n",

    "Click Yes.  You should then be prompted for your newly minted PSC password. \n",
    "***\n",
    "![PuTTY Password](/images/putty_password.png) \n",
    "***\n",
    "Finally we will see a login screen the `$HOME` directory on Bridges.  There are two files spaces that you will regularly use on Bridges. `$HOME` should be used for your GitHub repo's which will contain all of the scripts need to run your analyses.  `$SCRATCH` should be used to store your data as there is more space allocated and the compute nodes can access information from this pylong5 storage much faster.  To switch between the directory use the `cd`(change directory) command (i.e. to change from my `$HOME` to my `$SCRATCH` directory I would type `cd $SCRATCH`).\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux and Mac computers or using a virtual machine with your favorite Linux distro you do not need any additional software to SSH as the default terminal contains built-in support.  Open terminal and type `ssh username@bridges.psc.edu`.  You will be prompted to save the fingerprint so type `yes`.  Then put in your PSC password.  I previously saved my fingerprint key but your screen will look similar to this.\n",

    "If you haven't used Git or other version control software when working on coding or really any type of collaborative projects you should start right away.  Git is the command line tool behind the website GitHub which stores all the changes within a project.  Think of GitHub as your cloud backup for your project files.  There are a lot of great tutorials to get started with Git but two I have found to be very helpful are [Happy Git](http://happygitwithr.com/) and [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).  To get started we are going to fork (make our own copy) of the repo this notebook is in and put it on our Bridges `$HOME` directory.  Navigate to the [top page](https://github.com/dhbrand/reu_2018) of the reu_2018.  Click the fork button \n",

You can also use the [OnDemand](https://ondemand.bridges.psc.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) portal for quick tests.

    "There are a variety of tools available to transfer files to Bridges resources.  At a basic level the _scp_ and _sftp_ commands can do the trick for one off files or smaller datasets.  In this scenario you might think about making the directory into a _tar.gz_ file.  Next you could consider signing up for the [Globus File Transfer](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer) system which is fully supported at Brigdes.  There are also GUI applications such as [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) which are relatively easy to use after an initial configuration.  Finally you could use a more robust Science-as-a-Gateway method like Agave, see [AgavePlatform CLI](https://github.com/agaveplatform/agave-cli), which would require the use of a free [CyVerse Account](https://user.cyverse.org/).\n",
